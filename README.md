Work and projects of my Computer Science I course at Southwestern University.

## Content:
Exercises and projects done during my second semester of my first year, the exercises were given by the professor, but all the solutions were done by me. This course was an introduction to data structures in Java (bags, stacks, queues, lists, trees, heaps) as well as recursion and sorting algorithms.

##  Sections:
1. Assingments: Solutions to complex problems related to the topics, to reinforce the concepts, created entirely by me.
2. Labs: Solutions to simple problems related to the topics, to learn the concepts, created with occasional support from the professor.
