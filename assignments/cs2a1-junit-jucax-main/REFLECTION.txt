1. (3 points) Did you feel adequately prepared from CS1 to complete the SimpleStaticMethods? Please indicate which methods from this file were most difficult to complete.
Yes I did, the first problems were just about for loops and basic operations, the hardest was averages() method
because it include a 2D array and also I used some time to understand the instructions but after you explanation
it was not that hard to do.

2. (3 points) Did you feel adequately prepared from CS1 to complete the ScannerMethods? Please indicate which methods from this file were most difficult to complete.
Yes, it was more difficult than the SimpleStaticMethods mainly because I forgot some Scanner method like the use of
.hasNextInt() and that type of tools, but once I reviewed the Java documentation the problems was easy to solve, if
I have to choose one that was the hardest I would say getLines().

3. (2 points) In what SPECIFIC ways does THIS assignment help you move from a novice to an expert designer? How has THIS assignment built upon what was taught in the book and in class?
It was a very helpful assignment, because I helped me to understand how we can divide big problems into smaller solutions
or methods, It also showed me show the test files works and I'm excited with the fact that I can create my own tests for my
future programs.

4. (2 points) In what ways is design an innate talent held by few or a skill that can be learned by many? Answer the above question with respect to THIS SPECIFIC assignment. How does this assignment make you feel about the relationship between talent and skill?
I think design as most of the skills can be learn by practice and hard work, this assignment made me feel that programming and
design methods and solutions take time, and design tests even more, but also showed me that this way of thinking is going to be
benefecial for my next projects.
