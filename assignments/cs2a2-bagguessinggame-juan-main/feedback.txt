8/10%: REFLECTION.txt: thoughtful answers to each question
	-1: Code description claims you carefully account for duplicates,
	    but does not explain how. As you can see below, you did
	    not correctly handle duplicates.
	-1: I appreciate your answers to the talent/skill question,
	    but I feel as though I could copy/paste them into other
	    assignments and not be able to notice any issues. 
	    Basically, it is not clear how these answers are tied
	    to this specific assignment.
19/25%: ArrayBagTest.java: quality/correctness of additional tests
	-1: testAdd: do contains checks after each add call
	-1: testRemoveT: should remove all items from each bag
	-1: testGetFrequencyOf: check all items in each bag
	-1: testGetFrequencyOf: stringBag needs duplicates so that
	    its results are more interesting
	-2: testContains: an assertTrue check is needed for every
	    item in each bag
29/40%: Guess.java: correctness of guessing game code
	-10: getCorrectGuesses does not correctly handle duplicates.
	     The user could guess a value 5 times, and the score would
	     keep adding up even if the randomBag only contained the
	     value once.
	 -1: getCorrectGuesses: should use the positiveInt method
	     instead of the Scanner's nextInt method in case user
	     enters bad input.
24/25%: Guess.java: quality of comments and style/organization
	-1: Code in body of getCorrectGuesses could use more explanation.
