10/10%: REFLECTION.txt: thoughtful answers to each question
15/20%: ArrayQueueTest.java: Thorough testing of your queue implementation
	-1: Stored in wrong location
	-1: Need more interesting/larger number of values in queues
	-2: We did tests similar to testArrayQueue and 
	    testArrayQueueInt for the ArrayList recently.
	    Something similar should have been done here.
	-1: testIsEmpty: we're not sure that a newly constructed queue
	    will be empty.
33/35%: Scheduler.java: Correctly functioning scheduler simulation
	-1: When moving from start to ready after a process runs, use <= instead of <
	    as you do earlier (or have a shared helper method).
	-1: The "else" before CPU idle time should be "else if(!startQueue.isEmpty())"
8/10%: Scheduler.java: Style and comments in your scheduler simulation
	-1: Very similar code for moving from start to ready is used in two places.
	    Make a helper method.
	-1: There is no need to construct a new Process to replace p. Just put p back on.
24/25%: SchedulerTest.java: Thorough testing of your scheduler simulation
	-1: All tests use numbers divisible by 5 or 10, so the results
	    a bit too organized and regimented. Need more chaos.
