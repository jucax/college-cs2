Total: 96/100

10/10%: REFLECTION.txt: thoughtful answers to each question
37/40%: TwoDimensionTree.java: Correct functioning code
	-1: findEntry overly elaborate and incorrect. Just set result = rootEntry
		when both coordinates are equal
	-1: containsEntry needs an equals check
	-1: Iterator should throw NoSuchElementException
14/15%: TwoDimensionTree.java: Good comments, style, and efficiency
	-1: You should be using a helper method to compare points, since this
		comparison is needed in at least two places. This was the point
		of the compareLocations method from the lab day.
35/35%: TwoDimensionTreeTest.java: Correct/thorough tests
